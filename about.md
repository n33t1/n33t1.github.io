### Web/IOS Dev
Full stack, but mainly front-end. I'm using Vue.js for Web Dev while using React Native for IOS. If you also live in Boston and you use same stack or you are a backend developer, we can team up for hackathon!

### Research
I'm currently researching hardware acceleration for Machine Learning with [prof. Xue Lin](http://www.ece.neu.edu/people/lin-xue). I'm trying to write logs each week to document what I have learn so far. No paper yet, but hopefully I can get somewhere by the end of the semester.

### Drumming
Trying to be a punk/hardcore drummer. Big fan for electrocore, punk, art/indie rock. I listed a bunch of bands I'm into. BTW my prof pic is Tomoya from [One Ok Rock](http://www.oneokrock.com/)!
